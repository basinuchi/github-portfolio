# SSH CONNECTION
The reason for this project was to find a way I could control my windows laptop from my raspberrypi desktop.

First step was for me to open my command prompt on windows 
I followed the raspberypi documentation on how to to connect to a remote terminal, the command instructions `ssh <username>@<ip address>`
I took that literally, but after running through my diffculty through the youtbe search . I was able to interpret the command successfully.

Unfortunately this was not enough as I kept hittng a barrier “connection refused” 

Going back to the Youtube video I realized I had to update my windows laptop on my new plans to access this feature

so I went to the settings window and clicked on he apps and features, once there I clicked on optional features like the video suggested.

At the time of the process, the video instructed to search for SSH Cliens and install this feature, however, I only had the SSH server,
after installing it and moving forward in my project successfully, did I come back and find the SSH client, so if the client does not show up for you it only means this is your first time accessing that feature, windows is smart and will update that once you finalize your work.
Regardless of doing this, it still said connection refused, so I consulted the higher power, chatgpt.
Chatgpt gave me the requirements needed to to make sure I had my setup going properly.
