# SSH CONNECTION
The reason for this project was to find a way I could control my windows laptop from my raspberrypi desktop.

First step was for me to open my command prompt on windows 
I followed the raspberypi documentation on how to to connect to a remote terminal, the command instructions `ssh <username>@<ip address>`
I took that literally, but after running through my diffculty through the youtbe search . I was able to interpret the command successfully.

Unfortunately this was not enough as I kept hittng a barrier “connection refused” 

Going back to the Youtube video I realized I had to update my windows laptop on my new plans to access this feature
